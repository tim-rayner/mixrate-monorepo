### Building In Public

I'm building my highly anticipated project "Mixrate.io" for real this time... I promise ðŸ˜… 

To keep me accountable I am writing 'standup' style lines each day I work on the project, right here in this README! It's a part of my building in public initiative I'd like to employ as a part of this projects infancy. 

Wish me luck ðŸ¤ª


### 30.09.25
I'm starting off today with configuring the nx monorepo for Mixrate.io. This includes scaffolding the web app, and component libraries. I will also build seperate libs for other packages such as auth, and other services.
